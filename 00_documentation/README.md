## Project Description
The WADAR (Water Radar) project aims to use underground backscatter tags paired with an ultrawideband radar as an above-ground reader to detect soil moisture in a low-cost low-power method.

## Chipotle Radar Communication
This chapter compiles information regarding communication with the Chipotle Radar computer (BeagleBone Black).

**Laptop password:** _kattilab_

```bash
# SSH into the BeagleBone.
ssh root@192.168.7.2
```

```bash
# Shutdown board (imperative, forgetting to do so will require re-flashing the BBB).
sudo shutdown -h now
```

### SSH Debugging
In order to correctly set up communication between a device and the radar, the SSH communication must work without requiring passwords. This is essential to allow the WADAR scripts to capture and transmit data automatically without repeatedly prompting for a password. Both devices must have each other's SSH keys. Some solutions to issues are listed below from my experience.

- The basic steps from https://www.strongdm.com/blog/ssh-passwordless-login can be followed for the most part.
- Adding `PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa` to `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` when the SSH key isn't being accepted.
- Call `sudo systemctl restart ssh` to restart the SSH server after the config file is changed.
- Validate the setup by SSHing into the radar and SSHing back to our device without a password prompt.
- If you are on an Apple product, you will likely need to manually start an SSH server. To do this:
    1. Open "System Settings" > "General" > "Sharing".
    2. If disabled, enable "Remote Login".
    - Note that you will also need to use "192.168.6.1/2" rather than "192.168.7.1/2" with `ssh`.

## frameLogger Debugging and Resolution
This chapter documents the non-functionality of the radar after being re-flashed, and how it was debugged and solved.

### Debugging
The issue with `frameLogger.c` was identified at the line:
```c
status = radarHelper_configFromFile(rh, inFile_stage1, 1);
```

The variable `status` is not equal to `0`, resulting in the code terminating early. The function `radarHelper_configFromFile()` is from `radarHelper.h`.
```c
/**
   Helper function used to read in a user configuration JSON file and then set
   the radar configuration to match
   @param [in]  handle   Handle to the radar object
   @param [in] *path     Path to JSON configuration file
   @param [in] stage     Pre or post timing calibration register setup (1==pre calibration, 2==post calibration)
   @return 0 on success, otherwise 1 on failure
   @ingroup module_radarhelper
*/
```

After changing `inFile_stage1` from `stage1Chipotle.json` to `stage1.json`, this error message appears:
```c
ERROR 0x502: Unknown variable - PGSelect
    at: findVariable_ByName in src/support/Radarlib3_helpers.c:124
    from: NVA_VarGetIntProperties_ByName in src/Radarlib3.c:1015
```

### Resolution
The resolution required amending `frameLogger.c` using guidance from `sensorlogic.ai`.

Example JSON for `stage1.json` (Chipotle version):
```json
[
  {"DACMin" : 0},
  {"DACMax" : 8191},
  {"DACStep" : 32},
  {"Iterations" : 200},
  {"PulsesPerStep" : 32},
  {"FrameStitch" : 1},
  {"SamplingRate" : 0}
]
```

Additional fix in `frameLogger.c`:
```c
// Set the low frequency pulse generator
setIntValueByName(rh, "PulseGen", 1);
```

## Backscatter Tag Assembly

### Old Tag w/ Eval Boards
#### Overview
The following steps outline the required parts and step-by-step construction process for reassembling the backscatter tag.

#### Required Parts
- **Water-proof Container:** Polycase ML-46F
- **Teensy Microcontroller (Oscillator):** Adafruit Teensy
- **RF Switch:** NextWarehouse RF Switch
- **Antenna:** 5â€“18 GHz Vivaldi WA5VJB Antenna
- **Power Source:** Micro USB cable
- **Cable Glands:** GiBot Cable Glands
- **Antenna Mount:** 3D printed mount

#### Construction

1. **Prepare the Water-proof Container**
    - Drill a hole large enough for the PG11 cable gland.
    - Insert and secure the cable.
    - Test waterproofing.

2. **Mount the Oscillator and RF Switch**
    - Secure with tape and poster tack.
    - Add silica gel to keep the environment dry.

3. **Apply Static Shield**
    - Place a shield on the components to isolate the antenna.

4. **Install the Antenna**
    - Securely attach using a 3D printed mount.
    - Ensure alignment for optimal signal strength.

#### Final Checks
Ensure:
- Components are secure.
- Waterproofing is effective.
- Antenna is isolated.

## Wireless Communication with Tragedy

### Communication Protocol Between Radar and Tragedy
```bash
# Verify radar connection via USB.
dmesg show
```

```bash
# List available IPs.
ip l
```

```bash
# Toggle enxs IPs on.
sudo IP link set enxXXXXXX up
```

```bash
# Use DHclient to assign IP.
sudo dhclient enxXXXXXX
```

```bash
# Validate SSH and set up pubkeys for passwordless access.
ssh root@192.168.7.2
ssh tragedy@192.168.7.1
```

### Connecting Personal Device to Tragedy
```bash
# Remove problematic driver to use Realtek WiFi modem.
sudo rmmod iwlmvm
```


```bash
# Re-enable the driver.
sudo modprobe iwlmvm
```

### Other Commands
```bash
# Show available IPs.
ip l
```

```bash
# Start WiFi advertiser.
systemctl start
```

```bash
# Interrogate fidelity.
ethtool
```

```bash
# Display IPs and configuration.
cat /etc/dnsmasq.d/quadruped
```

```bash
# Verify WiFi connection.
dmesg
```

## BeagleBone Black Purgatory

### Internet Sharing through Host Machine

#### Step 1: Enable IP Forwarding
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

#### Step 2: Set up Network Address Translation
Configure iptables to forward traffic between wlp0s20f3 (Wi-Fi) and enx648cbbf22564 (USB Ethernet):
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlp0s20f3 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enx648cbbf22564 -o wlp0s20f3 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlp0s20f3 -o enx648cbbf22564 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

#### Step 3: Configure Beaglebone

1. SSH into the BeagleBone
```bash
ssh -v root@192.168.7.2
```

2. Set the default gateway to the host computer
```bash
sudo route add default gw 192.168.7.1
```

3. Update the DNS settings
```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the following
```plaintext
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

4. Test the connection
```bash
ping google.com
```

#### Notes: 
Since the BBB is running Debian Jessie, some stuff needs to be done to resolve further issues.

1. Switch to Achived Repositories
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Replace the contents with the following
```plaintext
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free
deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security jessie/updates main contrib non-free
```

2. Disable Repository SSL Verification
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf
```
Add the following
```plaintext
Acquire::Check-Valid-Until "false";
Acquire::https::Verify-Peer "false";
Acquire::https::Verify-Host "false";
```

3. Test success
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### Configuring BeagleBone with X11 Forwarding 
#### Step 1: Enable X11 Forwarding on the Host Machine (BBB)
Ensure your SSH daemon (sshd) is configured for X11 forwarding:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Confirm or set the following:
```plaintext
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes
```

Restart the SSH daemon:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### Step 2: Enable X11 Forwarding on the Client Machine (Your Computer)
In your local machine's SSH client configuration file:
```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```


Add the following:
```plaintext
Host 192.168.7.2
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

Verify that xauth is installed on the BeagleBone:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xauth
```

Check and restart your X11 server:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### Step 3: Test X11 Forwarding
SSH into the BeagleBone with X11 forwarding:
```bash
ssh -X root@192.168.7.2
```

Test X11 by running a graphical application:
```bash
gnuplot
plot sin(x)
```

#### Step 4: Resolve Issues with X Server
Kill any unnecessary X server processes:
```bash
ps aux | grep X
kill <PID>
```
