## Development Environment

The development environment of the platform is Debian 8.7 on the BeagleBone Black. Our custom radar is mounted on top of this embedded platform. We are in the process of creating a Docker paltform for standarized testing of post-processing algorithms. We will, as needed, permit ssh to the device through VPN.
